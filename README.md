Hi üëã My name Arya
===================================

Mobile Developer
----------------

I am a Software Engineer with 1 year of experience in developing user interfaces for small-scale companies. In addition to work experience, I have also undergone freelance projects for 1 year, expanding my expertise in website development and mobile-based applications such as Android.

As a student at AMIKOM University Purwokerto, I am pursuing a degree in a software development-related field. I also did self-study at Binar Academy, deepening my understanding as an Android Developer.

My internship experience at Citiasia Inc. provided valuable insights into software development in a professional environment. I am currently completing an intensive bootcamp program with Synrgy Academy BCA, deepening my knowledge in specific areas of software development.

Previously, I have also participated in PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk.'s Virtual Internship Project program, expanding my understanding in the banking industry and related technologies.

I believe that the combination of my work experience, formal education, and self-learning has formed a strong foundation in the world of software development. I am excited to continue learning and contributing more in this industry.
